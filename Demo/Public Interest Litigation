The Humble Petition of the Petitioner Above-Named

Most Respectfully Showeth:
	1.	Introduction and Background
This PIL is being filed by the petitioner, Ananya Sharma, a concerned citizen and environmental activist, to bring to the attention of the Hon’ble Court the escalating problem of air pollution in Delhi. The petitioner is acting in the interest of the general public to protect their right to clean air, as recognized under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
	2.	Facts Leading to the Petition
a. Delhi’s air quality has consistently ranked among the worst in the world, with air pollution levels often exceeding the permissible limits set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
b. Factors contributing to air pollution in Delhi include vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, crop stubble burning in neighboring states, and unfavorable weather conditions.
c. Air pollution has severe health impacts, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and poses a significant threat to vulnerable groups like children, elderly individuals, and those with pre-existing health conditions.
d. Despite multiple directives and orders issued by this Hon’ble Court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT), compliance with pollution control measures remains inadequate, endangering public health and well-being.
	3.	Violation of Fundamental Rights
The failure to control and mitigate air pollution levels constitutes a violation of the Fundamental Right to life and personal liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. Every citizen has a right to breathe clean air, and the inaction of the concerned authorities infringes upon this right.
	4.	Prayer for Relief
The petitioner, therefore, humbly prays that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to:
i. Issue an appropriate writ, order, or direction to the Union of India and the State of Delhi to implement effective and time-bound measures to control air pollution in Delhi, including but not limited to stricter vehicle emission standards, regulation of construction dust, and penalties for stubble burning in neighboring states.
ii. Direct the respondents to formulate and enforce a comprehensive, transparent, and accountable air quality management policy for Delhi, with a focus on reducing emissions from all major sources.
iii. Appoint an independent monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of anti-pollution measures, comprising representatives from relevant government departments, environmental experts, and civil society organizations.
iv. Order regular publication of real-time air quality data for public awareness and establish public reporting mechanisms to allow citizens to report violations of pollution control norms.
v. Grant any other relief that this Hon’ble Court may deem fit in the interest of justice, equity, and good conscience.
	5.	Interim Relief
Pending the final disposal of this petition, the petitioner respectfully prays for interim relief in the form of an immediate ban on all construction activities and a restriction on vehicular traffic in Delhi during periods of severe air pollution (Air Quality Index above 300) to safeguard public health.
